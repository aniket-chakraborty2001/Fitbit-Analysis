# Project On Fitbit-Analysis
Here I consider a Fitbit data that measures daily vitals in human. I perform data analysis and build Statistical Model from this data. For these purposes, I used both Python and R programming language.

## About the Data set:
The data set named **'FitBit Data'** is in csv format. It has 50 rows/observations and 10 columns/values. These column are also called attributes. The data set .csv file is also attached in the files section of this project. The different attributes that are used in this data are - 
* Sleeping -  A continuous variable. Indicates number of hours slept everyday.
* HeartRate - A continuous variable. Indicates heart rate that is measured everyday.
* Glucose - A continuous variable. Indicates blood sugar level.
* Cholesterol - A continuous variable. Indicates amout of body fat.
* Run - A continuous variable. Indiacte distnace covered evertday in meter unit.
* BMI - A continuous varibale. Indicates Body Mass Index of human being in kg/m^2 unit
* Weight - A continuous variable. Indicates the weight of the person in kilogram unit.
* Height - A continuous variable. Indicates the height of the person in meter unit.
* HealthIndex - A continuous variable. Indicates the health score out of 10. A score of 10 means perfect BMI.
* Condition - A categorical variable, indicates health condition. It has two levels - Good and Bad

## Used Packages/libraries in this project: 
Here both R programming and Python programming language are used. So, as a result some packages of the both languages are used in this project work.

* **Python Packages:** The python packages that are used in this project are - **Matplotlib.pyplot** and **style module from Matplotlib** **Pandas** , **Numpy**, and  **Seaborn**

* **R Packages:** The R packages used in this project work are - **Tidyverse and dplyr library from tidyverse package**

## Data Analysis Using Python
The first step of any project is data analysis. It also has some sub stages. They are - EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis), Data Manipulation and Data Visualization. Here we will discuss these three steps shortly.

* **EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis):** This step in the first basic step of any data analysis project. The things that comes under this step are -
           * Reading the data in a variable called 'data' using **pandas library**
           *  Checking the data types of the data frame's columns.
           * Observing the Column names.
           * Determining the shape of the data frame.
           * Getting the first 5 rows of the data frame.
