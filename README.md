# Project On Fitbit-Analysis
Here I consider a Fitbit data that measures daily vitals in human. I perform data analysis and build Statistical Model from this data. For these purposes, I used both Python and R programming language.

## About the Data set
The data set named **'FitBit Data'** is in csv format. It has 50 rows/observations and 10 columns/values. These column are also called attributes. The different attributes that are used in this data are -
